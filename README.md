# What is Rotten Smiley?
Rotten Smiley is an alternative to Pibby under a free license created by Stormwindsky. You can use it under any license, such as CC0 1.0, but with the “only” condition that you credit me.

In this universe, there is no alternative to the character Pibby. It's more about the basic concept of this apocalypse, but different for legal reasons.

# Here's how this Rotten Smiley spreads:

The Rotten Smiley, or simply RS,

spreads in a similar way to Physarum polycephalum, but more quickly, and changes color gradually but visibly to the naked eye.
